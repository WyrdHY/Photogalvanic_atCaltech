I think there are some things we would do about photo-galvanic project: 1. Bandgap and absorption investigation of materal; 2. Design of cavity and coupling; 3. Estimate the indensity of signal; 4. Try pulse pump on spiral/cavity

@Ericâ€…For you I would suggest 1. Learning how to simulate microcavity use comsol

One more paper I suggest for microcavity photonics: 04 righini

For absorption, read these two papers, think about how we could enhance absoprtion, like use UV light or anneal, and how to measure that, like UV spectroscopy used in bandgap measurement: 
1995 photoinduced generation of the second // 2000 photosensitive point defects
